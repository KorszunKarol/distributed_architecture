# Implementation Plan for WebSocket Client in Each Node

To enhance your distributed system with real-time monitoring capabilities via WebSockets, each node must function as a WebSocket client. Below is a structured list of tasks accompanied by pseudocode to guide a junior developer through implementing this functionality.

## 1. Understand the Requirements

Before diving into implementation, ensure clarity on the following:

- **Purpose**: Nodes need to send their current state and updates to the backend server in real-time.
- **Frequency**: Determine how often nodes should send updates (e.g., after every transaction, at regular intervals).
- **Data Structure**: Define the schema for the data being sent to ensure consistency.
- **Error Handling**: Plan for scenarios like connection drops or data transmission failures.
- **Security**: Consider authentication and encryption if sensitive data is involved.

## 2. Choose a WebSocket Client Library

Select a suitable WebSocket client library for Python. Popular choices include:

- **`websockets`**: An easy-to-use library for building WebSocket clients and servers.
- **`aiohttp`**: Supports WebSockets alongside HTTP functionalities.
- **`websocket-client`**: A straightforward library for WebSocket communication.

**Recommendation**: Use a library that aligns with your existing asynchronous implementations, such as `websockets`.

## 3. Integrate the WebSocket Client Library

### Tasks:

- **Install the Library**: Add the chosen WebSocket client library to your project dependencies.
- **Import the Library**: Include the necessary imports in each node's Python file where the WebSocket client will be implemented.

### Pseudocode:

```
Import the WebSocket client library
Import necessary modules for asynchronous operations, JSON handling, and logging
```

## 4. Establish the WebSocket Connection

### Tasks:

- **Define Connection Parameters**: Specify the backend server's WebSocket URL (e.g., `ws://localhost:8000/ws`).
- **Implement Connection Logic**: Create an asynchronous function to handle the connection, ensuring it can reconnect if the connection drops.

### Pseudocode:

```
Define the WebSocket server URI
Create a loop to attempt connection
    Try to connect to the WebSocket server
        Log successful connection
        Start sending updates
    Except connection failure
        Log the error
        Wait for a specified delay before retrying
```

## 5. Serialize and Send Node Data

### Tasks:

- **Define Data Schema**: Ensure consistency in the data structure sent to the backend. Utilize the existing `NodeData` interface to align the schema.
- **Implement Data Gathering**: Collect the current state of the node, including `node_id`, `layer`, `update_count`, etc.
- **Serialize Data**: Convert the node's state into JSON format for transmission.
- **Send Data**: Transmit the serialized data through the WebSocket connection.

### Pseudocode:

```
Create a function to gather node state
    Collect node_id, layer, update_count, last_sync_time, last_sync_count, current_data, operation_log

Serialize the node state into JSON format

Create a function to send serialized data through the WebSocket

Set an interval or trigger to call the send function at defined frequencies
```

*Note*: Replace `UPDATE_INTERVAL` with the desired time interval between updates.

## 6. Handle Incoming Messages (If Applicable)

If the backend needs to send commands or acknowledgments to the nodes, implement handlers for incoming messages.

### Tasks:

- **Define Message Types**: Establish different types of messages the backend might send (e.g., acknowledgments, commands).
- **Implement Handlers**: Create functions to process incoming messages based on their type.

### Pseudocode:

```
Create a function to receive messages from the WebSocket

On receiving a message:
    Parse the JSON payload
    If the message contains a command:
        Call the appropriate command handler with parameters
    If the message contains an acknowledgment:
        Process the acknowledgment
```

## 7. Implement Reconnection Logic

Ensure that nodes can gracefully handle disconnections by attempting to reconnect after a specified delay.

### Tasks:

- **Detect Disconnections**: Monitor the WebSocket connection for closures or errors.
- **Reconnect Strategy**: Define how and when the node should attempt to reconnect (e.g., exponential backoff, fixed intervals).

### Pseudocode:

```
In the connection loop:
    If connection is lost or an error occurs:
        Log the disconnection event
        Wait for a predefined interval
        Attempt to reconnect
```

*Note*: Using concurrent tasks allows sending and receiving messages simultaneously.

## 8. Integrate WebSocket Client into Node Lifecycle

Ensure that the WebSocket client starts when the node starts and gracefully shuts down when the node stops.

### Tasks:

- **Start WebSocket Client on Node Initialization**: Modify the node's `start` method to initiate the WebSocket connection.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensure that the WebSocket connection is properly closed when the node shuts down.

### Pseudocode:

```
In the node's start method:
    Initialize and start the WebSocket client asynchronously

In the node's stop method:
    If WebSocket connection is open:
        Close the connection gracefully
        Log the shutdown event
```

*Note*: Ensure that references to the active WebSocket connection are maintained for proper shutdown.

## 9. Logging and Monitoring

Maintain comprehensive logs to monitor the WebSocket client's performance and troubleshoot issues.

### Tasks:

- **Log Connection Events**: Record successful connections, disconnections, and reconnection attempts.
- **Log Data Transmission**: Monitor when data is sent and received.
- **Error Logging**: Capture and log any errors encountered during WebSocket communication.

### Pseudocode:

```
In connection logic:
    Log attempts to connect
    Log successful connections
    Log disconnections and reconnection attempts

In data transmission functions:
    Log when data is sent
    Log any errors during sending

In message handling functions:
    Log received messages and any processing errors
```

## 10. Testing the WebSocket Implementation

Ensure that the WebSocket client functions correctly within each node.

### Tasks:

- **Unit Testing**: Write tests to verify individual components of the WebSocket client.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the WebSocket connection in the context of the entire node to ensure seamless data transmission.
- **Mock Backend**: Utilize a mock WebSocket server to simulate backend responses and commands.
- **Simulate Failures**: Test how the client handles connection drops, data transmission failures, and reconnection attempts.

### Pseudocode:

```
Create a mock WebSocket server to simulate backend behavior

Write tests to:
    Verify successful connection establishment
    Verify data is sent at correct intervals
    Verify incoming messages are handled appropriately
    Simulate disconnections and ensure reconnection logic works
    Check that logs are recorded as expected
```

*Note*: Use asynchronous testing frameworks to handle the asynchronous nature of WebSocket communications.

## 11. Documentation and Code Review

Maintain clear documentation to aid future development and facilitate code reviews.

### Tasks:

- **Document Functions**: Provide descriptions for each function and its purpose.
- **Explain Data Structures**: Clearly outline the structure of the data being sent and received.
- **Code Comments**: Add inline comments to clarify complex logic or important sections.
- **Review for Consistency**: Ensure that the implementation aligns with the overall system architecture and replication strategies.

### Pseudocode:

```
For each function:
    Add a description of its purpose and behavior

For data structures:
    Describe the fields and their meanings

In complex logic sections:
    Add comments explaining the steps and reasoning
```

## 12. Security Enhancements (Optional but Recommended)

Enhance the security of WebSocket communications to protect data integrity and confidentiality.

### Tasks:

- **Authentication**: Implement authentication mechanisms to verify node identities before allowing data transmission.
- **Encryption**: Use secure WebSockets (`wss://`) to encrypt data in transit.
- **Validate Incoming Data**: Ensure that the data received from the backend is sanitized and validated to prevent malicious injections.

### Pseudocode:

```
In connection initialization:
    Include authentication tokens or credentials as part of the connection request

In data handling:
    Validate the structure and content of incoming messages

Ensure all data transmissions occur over encrypted channels
```

*Note*: Manage authentication tokens securely, ensuring they are stored and transmitted safely.
