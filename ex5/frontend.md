# Implementation Plan for Frontend Architecture Using Next.js

To visualize your distributed system's real-time data, the frontend will be built using Next.js. This document outlines a structured list of tasks to guide the development process, including setup, component design, WebSocket integration, and user interface features.

## 1. Understand Frontend Requirements

Before starting the implementation, ensure clarity on the frontend's objectives and functionalities:

- **Real-time Visualization**: Display nodes in a graph that update in real-time via WebSockets.
- **Node Interaction**: Highlight nodes when their data updates and allow users to examine node-specific details.
- **Transaction History**: Present a panel displaying all transaction histories.
- **User Interface Layout**: Organize the layout to include the graph view, node details panel, and transaction history panel.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the interface is responsive and user-friendly across devices.

## 2. Choose Frontend Libraries and Tools

Select suitable libraries and tools to facilitate development and enhance functionality:

- **Graph Visualization**: Choose a library like `react-flow`, `d3.js`, or `vis-network` for dynamic graph rendering.
- **State Management**: Utilize React Context or a state management library like Redux to manage application state.
- **Styling**: Decide on a styling framework or library, such as Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, or styled-components.
- **WebSocket Client**: Use the native WebSocket API or a library like `socket.io-client` for WebSocket communication.
- **Prototyping Tools**: Consider tools like Figma or Sketch for UI prototyping before implementation.

## 3. Set Up Next.js Project Structure

Initialize and configure the Next.js project to establish a solid foundation:

- **Initialize Project**: Create a new Next.js application using the recommended setup.
- **Organize Directories**: Structure directories for components, pages, styles, hooks, and utilities.
- **Configure Webpack**: Adjust Webpack settings if necessary for optimal performance or integration with chosen libraries.
- **Set Up Linting and Formatting**: Implement ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency.
- **Version Control**: Ensure the frontend code is properly managed within the existing repository.

## 4. Design User Interface Layout

Plan the overall layout and design of the frontend to ensure a cohesive and intuitive user experience:

- **Main Layout**: Divide the interface into main sections:
  - **Left Section**: Graph view displaying nodes and their connections.
  - **Right Section**: Two vertical panels:
    - **Top Panel**: Node details panel to examine individual node data.
    - **Bottom Panel**: Transactions panel listing all transaction histories.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Navigation**: Incorporate navigation elements if necessary for additional functionalities or settings.

### Prototyping:

```
Sketch a wireframe illustrating the main layout:
- Graph view occupying the majority of the screen.
- Node details panel on the top-right.
- Transactions panel below the node details panel.
```

## 5. Implement WebSocket Integration

Establish real-time communication with the backend to receive updates:

- **Connect to WebSocket Server**: Initialize a WebSocket connection to the backend server's URI.
- **Handle Incoming Messages**: Define how incoming data will be processed and reflected in the UI.
- **Manage Connection Lifecycle**: Implement reconnection logic to handle disconnections gracefully.
- **State Updates**: Update the application state based on received data to trigger UI updates.

### Pseudocode:

```
Initialize WebSocket connection to ws://localhost:8000
On receiving a message:
    Parse the message data
    Update the state corresponding to the nodes or transactions
On connection error or close:
    Log the error
    Attempt to reconnect after a delay
```

## 6. Develop Graph Visualization Component

Create a dynamic graph that reflects the state of the nodes in real-time:

- **Node Representation**: Display each node as a graph node with visual indicators for status.
- **Edge Representation**: Show connections between nodes to represent relationships or replication links.
- **Real-time Updates**: Update the graph dynamically based on incoming WebSocket data.
- **Node Illumination**: Implement a visual effect to highlight nodes when their data updates.
- **Interactivity**: Allow users to interact with the graph, such as selecting nodes to view details.

### Pseudocode:

```
Define Graph component:
    Render nodes and edges based on the current state
    On node data update:
        Apply illumination effect to the updated node
        Update node properties in the graph
```

## 7. Develop Node Details Panel

Provide detailed information about each node in a dedicated panel:

- **Display Node Data**: Show attributes such as node ID, layer, update count, data store info, etc.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Reflect real-time changes as node data updates.
- **Selection Mechanism**: Allow users to select a node from the graph to view its details.

### Pseudocode:

```
Define NodeDetails component:
    Display selected node's data fields
    Update displayed data when the selected node's state changes
```

## 8. Develop Transactions Panel

Present a panel that lists all transaction histories:

- **Transaction Listing**: Display transactions with details such as type, affected nodes, timestamps.
- **Real-time Updates**: Append new transactions to the list as they occur.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Enable users to filter transactions by type, node, or date.
- **User Interaction**: Allow users to click on transactions to view more details if necessary.

### Pseudocode:

```
Define Transactions component:
    Render a list of transactions from the state
    On new transaction:
        Add to the top or bottom of the list
    Implement filtering and sorting functionalities
```

## 9. Implement State Management

Manage the application state to ensure data consistency across components:

- **Global State**: Manage nodes' data, selected node, and transaction history.
- **Update Mechanism**: Define how the state is updated based on WebSocket messages.
- **Communication Between Components**: Ensure that components like Graph, Node Details, and Transactions panel reflect the current state accurately.

### Pseudocode:

```
Initialize global state to store:
    Nodes data
    Transaction history
    Selected node

Define state update functions:
    Update nodes on receiving node data
    Append transactions on receiving new transactions
    Set selected node on user selection
```

## 10. Add UI Interactions and Visual Cues

Enhance the user experience with interactive elements and visual feedback:

- **Node Highlighting**: Highlight nodes in the graph when their data updates.
- **Selection Feedback**: Indicate which node is currently selected in the graph and the details panel.
- **Transaction Notifications**: Optionally add notifications or indicators for new transactions.
- **Responsive Controls**: Ensure that interactions like selecting nodes and filtering transactions are intuitive.

### Pseudocode:

```
On node data update:
    Trigger visual effect (e.g., glow) on the node in the graph

On node selection:
    Highlight the node in the graph and display its details in the panel
```

## 11. Testing and Quality Assurance

Ensure the frontend functions correctly and provides a smooth user experience:

- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components to ensure they render correctly and handle state changes.
- **Integration Testing**: Verify that components interact as expected, especially with real-time data.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Simulate user interactions to ensure the entire workflow operates smoothly.
- **Performance Testing**: Assess the application's performance, especially the real-time graph updates.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Gather feedback from stakeholders to refine the UI and functionalities.

### Pseudocode:

```
Define tests for:
    Graph component rendering and updating
    NodeDetails component data display
    Transactions component list updates and filters
    WebSocket connection and data handling

Run tests with sample data and simulated WebSocket messages
```

## 12. Documentation and Code Review

Maintain clear documentation and ensure code quality through reviews:

- **Component Documentation**: Document the purpose and behavior of each component.
- **Data Flow Documentation**: Explain how data flows through the application and how state is managed.
- **UI Design Documentation**: Outline the design choices and layout rationale.
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to maintain consistency and identify potential issues.

### Pseudocode:

```
For each component:
    Add a description of its functionality

For state management:
    Document how state is initialized, updated, and accessed

For WebSocket integration:
    Explain the data handling and lifecycle management
```

## 13. Deployment Considerations

Prepare the frontend for deployment, ensuring it is optimized and secure:

- **Build Optimization**: Optimize the Next.js build for performance, including code splitting and lazy loading.
- **Environment Configuration**: Set up environment variables for different deployment environments.
- **Security**: Implement necessary security measures, such as protecting against XSS and ensuring secure WebSocket connections.
- **Hosting**: Choose a suitable hosting platform that supports Next.js applications.
